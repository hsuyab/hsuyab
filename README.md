#### ðŸ§  Research @ Purdue

At Purdue, my research focuses on **spatial understanding in multimodal LLMs** â€” investigating whether models develop internal 3D world representations or rely on surface correlations. Iâ€™m using synthetic scene generation, mechanistic interpretability, and causal probes to uncover the underlying reasoning patterns.
