### Hi there, I’m Ayush 👋

I’m a Machine Learning researcher and engineer, currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science & Statistics at Purdue University. I specialize in building robust, efficient ML systems — from fine-tuning large language models to optimizing cloud infrastructure and scaling time series solutions.

#### 🧠 Research @ Purdue

At Purdue, my research focuses on **spatial understanding in multimodal LLMs** — investigating whether models develop internal 3D world representations or rely on surface correlations. I’m using synthetic scene generation, mechanistic interpretability, and causal probes to uncover the underlying reasoning patterns.

#### 💼 Previously @ TCS Research

As a Machine Learning Engineer, I:

* 🧠 Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., LLaMA 7B) for tool usage and function calling using synthetic data and LoRA-based optimization.
* ⏱️ Designed a time series forecasting pipeline that outperformed Prophet by 36% (sMAPE) across 100+ regions with adaptive drift-handling and retraining.
* ☁️ Built a cloud optimization framework for compute budget control, using runtime prediction models and resource scaling policies.

#### 🛠️ What I enjoy working on

* Fine-tuning and aligning LLMs for reasoning and tool use.
* Designing ML systems with low latency, high throughput, and cost efficiency.
* Building agents that combine symbolic and neural reasoning for better real-world performance.
* Open-ended research at the intersection of interpretability and generative AI.
